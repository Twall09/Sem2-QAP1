Answers:

1. This took me probably about 6-8 hours overall. I worked on it throughout
   the week a couple hours a day until I ran into trouble with my laptop. (Thank you for the extension).

2. I used your lectures and coursework to help refresh my brain. I also used Google, Youtube, Pexels.

3. I did not need anyones help while completing this one. A lot of the coursework guided me.

4. I also did not ask any questions to the instructors, only when my laptop broke, I had to ask for an extension
   because I could not complete anything for 2 days.

5. I found this project particlarly easy to complete. Obviously there is a lot of information, and it is 
   hard to remember everything, but with the help of course work and resources, it goes by pretty smoothly.
